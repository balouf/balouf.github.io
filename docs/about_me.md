## Short bio


Fabien Mathieu is the research leader at Swapcard where he works with his team focusing on diverse topics from explainable recommendations to matching algorithms.

Prior to Swapcard, he went back and forth between the industry and the academic worlds, working for Orange, Inria, and Bell Labs.

Former student from the École Normale Supérieure, he holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science, wrote more than 100 research papers, and supervised many PhD students.

## FAQ

### Why is my Github username Balouf?

The answer is actually simple: 
In South of France, where I was born, 
it is common to use the prefix *Lou* to form nickname, like *El* in Spanish.

For exemple, a good-looking person could be nicknamed *Lou Bèu*.

My nickname from *Provence* is just *Lou Fab*, after my first name, and I wanted to use it in Github but I registered too late and someone else already took it. So I scrambled the letters and *balouf* came out! 

### Technomage ?!?!?!

I chose the job title *technomage* because it is much cooler than *Senior AI Research Scientist*.

I have been in many companies and each of them has its own system of grades and positions:
* In Orange there was a *category* system. *E*-people aim for *F*, *F* people aim for *G*...
* In the academic world there is *assistant*/*professor* (or *researcher*/*director*), up to the *uncategorized* category.
* In Bell Labs, two independent systems of class (*III-A*) and grades (*10*) existed simultaneously, not to mention the ultimate *Distinguished Member of Technical Staff* (DMTS) title.
* Swapcard has a traditional junior/senior system with sub-grades, but they allowed me to define my own title ;)

It can be easy to get lost, so I decided to craft my own title. 
As a fan of [Babylon 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5), I ended up with Technomage.

<div id="bio">I was a student at the <i>Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure</i>, rue d'Ulm from 1998 to 2002. I completed a Ph.D in Computer Science in 2004. My dissertation titled <a href="http://hal.inria.fr/tel-00667563" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Web Graphs and PageRank-like measurements</a> was supervised by Prof. Michel Habib and permanent INRIA researcher Laurent Viennot. From 2005 to 2010, I was a researcher in the Traffic and Resource Allocation group at Orange Labs, aka France Telecom R&amp;D, aka CNET, part of the Transport &amp; Packet Networks lab. In 2009, I passed the <i>Habilitation Ã Â  Diriger des Recherches</i> (official agreement for supervising PhD students) on the topic of <a href="http://hal.inria.fr/tel-00667414" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">P2P and acyclic preference-based systems</a>. Since 2010, I work at <a href="http://www.lincs.fr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LINCS</a>, a joint lab between academics and industrials, first as <a href="http://www.inria.fr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">INRIA</a> in the <a href="http://gang.inria.fr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GANG</a> research team (2010-2013), then in the MathDyn team of <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NOKIA Bell Labs</a>.
Since 2022, I work for Swapcard doing research on recommendation algorithms.</div>
