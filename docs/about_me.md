## FAQ

### Why is my Github username Balouf?

The answer is actually simple: 
In South of France, where I was born, 
it is common to use the prefix *Lou* to form nickname, like *El* in Spanish.

For exemple, a good-looking person could be nicknamed *Lou Bèu*.

My nickname from *Provence* is just *Lou Fab*, after my first name, and I wanted to use it in Github but I registered too late and someone else already took it. So I scrambled the letters and *balouf* came out! 

### Technomage ?!?!?!

I chose the job title *technomage* because it is much cooler than *Senior AI Research Scientist*.

I have been in many companies and each of them has its own system of grades and positions:
* In Orange there was a *category* system. *E*-people aim for *F*, *F* people aim for *G*...
* In the academic world there is *assistant*/*professor* (or *researcher*/*director*), up to the *uncategorized* category.
* In Bell Labs, two independent systems of class (*III-A*) and grades (*10*) existed simultaneously, not to mention the ultimate *Distinguished Member of Technical Staff* (DMTS) title.
* Swapcard has a traditional junior/senior system with sub-grades, but they allowed me to define my own title ;)

It can be easy to get lost, so I decided to craft my own title. 
As a fan of [Babylon 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5), I ended up with Technomage.
