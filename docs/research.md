# Research

My principal fields of interest:
* Game Theory (Matchings, Voting Systems)
* Large Networks Modeling and Performance Analysis
* Scientometrics (the science of publications)
* Efficient, Unsupervised Natural Language Processing
* Peer-to-peer systems

[All my publications](https://cv.hal.science/fabien-mathieu) are now managed via [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/), the French open archive for research.

Some of my GitHub repositories are related to my research. [See them here!](https://github.com/search?q=user:balouf+topic:research&type=repositories)

## Selected Publications

* **[Online Stochastic Matching: A Polytope Perspective](https://hal.science/hal-03502084v5):** Items arrive in a system. Compatible items can be matched and exit the system. How many degrees of freedom can we have without making the system unstable?
* **[Performance of Balanced Fairness in Resource Pools: A Recursive Approach](https://inria.hal.science/hal-01630420v3/document):** In this article, we proposed a simple formula (*Theorem 1*) that allows us to predict the service rates in a scenario where multiple job types can be treated by multiple servers following some assignment graph.
* **[Kleinberg's Grid Unchained](https://inria.hal.science/hal-02052607v1/document):** As part of the [Kleinberg's Grid Trilogy](https://github.com/balouf/kleinberg-grid-simulator), we aim to shed new light on [Kleinberg's model for small world routing](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch20.pdf) using a fast, dedicated simulator. Despite being entirely simulation-centric, this work was published in the [**Theoretical Computer Science** journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theoretical-computer-science).
* **[Can a Condorcet Rule Have a Low Coalitional Manipulability?](https://hal.science/hal-01369877v1/document):** This article on voting systems is centered around a simple result: if low (coalitional) manipulability is sought, then methods that respect the Condorcet criterion should be considered.
* **[Epidemic live streaming: optimal performance trade-offs](https://inria.hal.science/hal-00668529v1/document):** What is the performance (loss and delay) of gossip-like chunk diffusion techniques?
* **[Self-stabilization in preference-based systems](https://inria.hal.science/hal-00667082v1):** The PBS framework helps understand the performance of unstructured distributed systems where interactions are driven by participant interests. One key ingredient is *acyclicity*, a property ensured by node- and edge-based metrics, which provides convergence guarantees.
