[My public packages are on GitHub and can be installed with pip or uv.](https://github.com/search?q=user:balouf+topic:package&type=repositories)

Below are some of my selected open-source Python packages:

## Selected Packages

* [Package Helper 3 (PH3)](https://balouf.github.io/package-helper-3/): A boilerplate to create, develop, and maintain a Python package with uv.
* [A Generic Information Search... With a Mind of its Own! (GISMO)](https://balouf.github.io/gismo/): A low-cost NLP tool to rank and organize a corpus of documents according to a query.
* [Remote Compression (RComp)](https://balouf.github.io/remote-compression/): Helps perform x265 video compression locally or on a remote server.
* [Stable Matching Useless Pictures (SMUP)](https://balouf.github.io/smup/): Stable Matching is a powerful theory with many practical applications. SMUP uses it to generate random pictures that are sometimes visually appealing, though intentionally without practical use.
* [Mosayc](https://balouf.github.io/mosayc/): Another tool based on *Stable Matching*: generate a big picture that is a mosaic of many smaller ones. Perfect for personalized gifts!
* [Bag of Factors (BoF)](https://balouf.github.io/bof/): A drop-in replacement for [FuzzyWuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) that allows you to analyze a corpus by its factors.
